# ODriveHardware
High performance motor control

This repository contains the circuit board design of ODrive. The other related repositories are:
* [Odrive Firmware](https://github.com/madcowswe/OdriveFirmware): Firmware that runs on the board.
* [ODrive](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODrive): Configuration and analysis scripts that runs on a PC.

There is also ODriveFPGA, which contains the FPGA logic and software that runs on the FPGA based ODrive. This is not currently in development, but may be resumed at some later date.
