# ODriveHardware
This project is all about accuratly driving brushless motors, for cheap. The aim is to make it possible to use inexpensive brushless motors in high performance robotics projects.

If you want to get your hands on a board, check out [this post](https://hackaday.io/project/11583-odrive-high-performance-motor-control/log/40702-boards-and-development).

This repository contains the circuit board design of ODrive. The other related repositories are:
* [ODriveFirmware](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODriveFirmware): Firmware that runs on the board.
* [ODrive](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODrive): Configuration and analysis scripts that runs on a PC.

There is also [ODriveFPGA](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODriveFPGA), which contains the FPGA logic and software that runs on the FPGA based ODrive. This is not currently in development, but may be resumed at some later date.

## Odrive v3 board
The pinout from the microcontroller to the board is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QXDCs1IRtUyG__M_9WruWOheywb-GhOwFtfPcHuN2Fg/edit?usp=sharing).
